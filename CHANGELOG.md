## [0.20.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- **Critical:** `ClientInitialAccess` minted a new token on every reconcile, and could never revoke one
  - `setAccessID` recorded an issued token's ID in an annotation, but `getAccessID` looked for a status condition of type `AccessID` and returned its message. Nothing ever set such a condition, so `getAccessID` always returned empty.
  - `Observe` therefore reported the token absent immediately after `Create`, so the reconciler ran `Create` again on every pass and minted a fresh initial-access token each time, without bound.
  - `Delete` saw an empty ID, skipped the API entirely and released the finalizer anyway, so the token was never revoked in Keycloak.
  - `getAccessID` now reads the annotation `setAccessID` writes, matching every other controller here. Affected every released version up to and including v0.20.0.
  - Found while closing a test-coverage gap: this controller was one of ten whose tests exercised a mock rather than the controller, so it sat at 0% and neither CI nor `make reviewable` could see the defect.

  #### Action required if you ran v0.20.0 or earlier

  Upgrading stops the bleeding but does not clear the backlog. The fix stops new tokens being minted and lets `Delete` revoke the one it knows about; it cannot recover the IDs of tokens already minted, because `setAccessID` overwrote the annotation on each pass and only the most recent ID survives. Those tokens remain valid in Keycloak until their own expiry, and are not revocable through this provider.

  1. **Upgrade to v0.20.1 or later first.** On an older version the provider is still minting on every reconcile, so cleaning up before upgrading is pointless.
  2. **Revoke the accumulated tokens.** Either revoke every one of them, or revoke all but the single ID named in the resource's `keycloak.crossplane.io/access-id` annotation if you want that one to keep working:

     ```
     GET    /admin/realms/{realm}/clients-initial-access
     DELETE /admin/realms/{realm}/clients-initial-access/{id}
     ```

     Each entry returns `id`, `timestamp`, `expiration`, `count` and `remainingCount`. Judge each one by its own `expiration` rather than assuming — the provider passes `spec.forProvider.expiration` through to Keycloak verbatim as seconds, so lifetime is whatever each resource declared, and entries minted during the affected window cluster in `timestamp`. Keycloak also only ever returns the token *value* at creation time, so the accumulated ones cannot be recovered even in principle.

  3. **Revoking everything is the simplest option and is self-healing.** If you delete every entry, including the annotated one, the next reconcile finds no matching token, `Observe` reports `ResourceExists: false`, and `Create` mints one fresh token and rewrites the annotation. The new token's value appears in `status.token` on the resource. You do not need to recreate the `ClientInitialAccess` resource.

  These tokens authorise client registration in the realm — they are not user session tokens, and they cannot be used to authenticate as an existing user. The exposure is that anyone holding one can register a client in the realm until it expires or is revoked.

- **Critical:** Debug HTTP logging wrote credentials to the pod log
  - Setting `KEYCLOAK_PROVIDER_DEBUG_HTTP=true` leaked the bearer token and any credential in a request or response body.
  - Password redaction existed but was applied at only one of the three logging sites. The admin wire dump re-marshalled the raw body and cloned the headers verbatim, so both the `Authorization` header and the payload's password reached stdout — the redaction was bypassed entirely. That dump runs on realm creation (`POST /admin/realms`).
  - The response dump printed the full body and the full header set, so a `clientSecret` in a response, or a `Set-Cookie`, was logged as-is.
  - Redaction now covers every logging site. Sensitive headers (`Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `X-Authorization`) are replaced in a clone, leaving the real request untouched. Credential-bearing JSON fields are replaced across both camelCase and snake_case spellings — the previous pattern matched only `"password":"..."` and missed `clientSecret`, `privateKey`, `access_token` and others.
  - `fetchOAuth2Token` was already outside this path and remains unlogged.
  - A log-injection vector in the same block is also closed: newlines and carriage returns are stripped from the request URL before it is logged, so a crafted path cannot forge log entries.

### Added
- **Tests covering the debug log output itself.** The redaction helpers had no coverage, which is why the bypass went unnoticed; worse, tests written against the helpers alone pass even when the logging sites stop calling them. These drive `doRequest` against a test server with debug enabled and assert on what it actually writes.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-10-03

This release contains a breaking change to `ClientRoleMapping` and `ClientScopeMapping` semantics. No migration is required; see the note under Changed.

### Fixed
- **`IdentityProvider` could never be created; the scope controllers could not be deleted once their client was gone**
  - The create-direction twin of the `ProtocolMapper` fix in v0.19.9. `GetIdentityProvider` propagated Keycloak's 404 as a plain error, and the first `Observe` of any new resource always 404s — so the reconciler aborted before `Create` and an `IdentityProvider` could not be created at all. Both live resources were 18 days old and had never been created, while looking correct in gitops.
  - `ClientDefaultScopes` and `ClientOptionalScopes` now report `ResourceExists: false` when the client is absent, so a resource left behind by a decommissioned client releases its finalizer. Found live: `rossgolderltd-k8s-bankrut-master-default-scopes`, terminating since 2026-10-01.
  - `internal/clients` gains `ErrNotFound`, wrapped by a `notFoundError` that keeps the previous message shape — several callers still match on the `"404"` substring — so `errors.Is` can be used without breaking them.
  - A failure to *reach* Keycloak still returns an error in every case, so a live resource is never mistaken for a missing one. Each controller has a test pinning that, because getting it wrong would send the reconciler to `Create` on every poll.
  - Updates one pre-existing test that asserted the old behaviour — that a missing client is an error — to assert the new contract.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `ClientRoleMapping` and `ClientScopeMapping` sets are now additive
  - Each resource now owns only the roles or scopes it declares, so several resources may share one parent. Previously each was authoritative over the *complete* set: `rolesMatch`/`scopesMatch` required `len(desired) == len(current)`, so a sibling's entry made a resource permanently out of date and drove an endless update loop, and deleting one resource stripped every remaining entry.
  - `Update` removes only entries the resource applied that the spec no longer declares. An entry added to the parent outside the resource — by a sibling, or directly in Keycloak — is left alone. It is no longer removed on sight as it was before.
  - `Delete` removes only the entries the resource owns, instead of every entry on the parent.
  - Ownership is carried on `status.appliedRoles`/`status.appliedScopes`, which previously recorded the parent's whole set and now records what this resource applied. That field's meaning has changed.
  - Drift correction is unchanged: a declared entry removed in Keycloak is restored, because ownership survives its removal from the parent.
  - **No migration required.** For a resource that is up to date at upgrade time the recorded set equals the declared set, so behaviour is identical. A role or scope dropped from the spec afterwards is still removed exactly once. Resources that were previously fighting over a shared parent converge instead of deleting each other's entries.

### Added
- **`internal/controller/mappingreconcile`**: the shared additive reconciliation used by both mapping controllers, covering ownership tracking, up-to-date checks, and add/remove planning.
- **Regression tests driving both controllers' `Observe`, `Update` and `Delete`** against a recording client, covering a sibling's entries on a shared parent, removal restricted to owned entries, `Delete` leaving siblings intact, drift restoration, a failed add not being recorded as applied, and the upgrade path from the previous exhaustive ownership. Each was confirmed to fail against the previous behaviour.

### Resolved known issues
- Both issues recorded against v0.19.9 are resolved here: the parent-resolution wedge (`ClientDefaultScopes`, `ClientOptionalScopes`) by the `IdentityProvider` fix above, and the exhaustive mapping semantics by the additive change below.

## [0.19.9] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- **`internal/controller/deletecomplete`**: shared helper recording that a controller has finished releasing its external resource, so the reconciler can reach `RemoveFinalizer`. `Groups` moves onto it, unchanged in behaviour.
- **Structural regression test across every controller's `Observe`**, failing if any can only ever report `ResourceExists: true` — the shape that prevents a managed resource from ever terminating. It follows same-package delegation, so a controller whose `Observe` delegates to a shared helper is judged on the helper's body.

### Fixed
- **Groups controller: deleting a resource no longer wedges it forever on its finalizer**
  - The reconciler removes a managed resource's finalizer only once `Observe` reports the external resource gone, and while `Observe` keeps reporting it present it re-runs `Delete` on every pass. `Observe` hardcoded `ResourceExists: true`, so that verification never succeeded: every `Groups` delete re-entered the delete branch indefinitely. The object never terminated, the condition pair stayed at `Ready=False/Deleting` + `Synced=True/ReconcileSuccess`, nothing was logged (that path logs at debug), and each pass re-applied the membership removals — so a user's group membership oscillated against any surviving resource still declaring it. Observed during a realm migration, where two terminating resources stripped `admin` and `backups` every few seconds while their replacement re-added them.
  - `Delete` now records completion in a `keycloak.m.crossplane.io/delete-completed` annotation, patched explicitly because the reconciler only writes back status. `Observe` reports `ResourceExists: false` once it is present, so the reconciler reaches `RemoveFinalizer`. `Delete` also short-circuits on that annotation, so it cannot release memberships another resource has since declared.
  - The two paths with nothing left to release — user unresolvable, group refs unresolvable — previously returned without recording anything and would have hung identically; both now record completion.
  - A failed release is not recorded as complete, so the finalizer is not dropped while the membership is still in Keycloak. The existing tolerance of a `404` from Keycloak is unchanged.

- **Delete never completed for nine further controllers, not just `Groups`**
  - Auditing every `Observe` for a path that reports the external resource as absent found nine more with none. All wedged on their finalizer when deleted, and where `Delete` has side effects those repeated on every reconcile pass.
  - `authenticationflow`, `authorizationpolicy`, `identityprovider`, `clientrolemapping` and `clientscopemapping` now record completion via `deletecomplete`, report `ResourceExists: false` once recorded, and short-circuit `Delete` so a repeat call cannot release state a sibling resource has since declared.
  - `realmkeys`, `events` and `realmimpexp` have a no-op `Delete` — nothing in Keycloak to release — so their `Observe` reports `ResourceExists: false` as soon as deletion is requested. Their `Delete` bodies did nothing at all and returned `nil`, yet the finalizer still could not be removed.
  - `clientdefaultscopes`, `clientoptionalscopes` and `clientscope` were re-checked after the structural test flagged them: each delegates to a shared `ObserveX` helper that does report absence, so they are not affected.

- **`ProtocolMapper`: a mapper left behind by a decommissioned client could never be deleted**
  - A second, distinct reason a managed resource never terminates. The reconciler aborts a reconcile when `Observe` returns an error, so it never reaches `RemoveFinalizer`. `resolveClientUUID` failed permanently once a parent client was removed from Keycloak, so any mapper left behind held its finalizer forever and re-issued the lookup on every poll — adding load against an API that was already rate limiting.
  - `Observe` now distinguishes *the client is absent* from *Keycloak could not be reached*, and reports `ResourceExists: false` for the former. A mapper cannot outlive its client, so there is nothing left to release and the reconciler can finalise. Transport and auth failures still surface as errors, so a live mapper is never mistaken for a missing one.
  - Found in `ROSSGolderLtd`: three mappers terminating since 2026-10-01 with `client "k8s-bankrut-master" not found`, a client no longer declared in gitops.

### Known issues
- **A parent object that cannot be resolved still blocks deletion generally.** `ClientDefaultScopes` and `ClientOptionalScopes` resolve a client the same way and would wedge the same way if their parent client were removed. Not fixed here — `ProtocolMapper` was fixed because it was demonstrably broken in a live cluster, and the same treatment should be reviewed for the two scope controllers.
- **`ClientRoleMapping` and `ClientScopeMapping` own the complete set, undocumented.** `rolesMatch`/`scopesMatch` require `len(desired) == len(current)`, so each resource is exhaustive over its parent rather than additive, and `Delete` removes the entire set. Two resources for the same parent would fight as `Groups` did, and deleting one removes its siblings' entries. Left unchanged here — this is a semantics decision (make them additive, or document and guard the exhaustive behaviour), not a mechanical fix.

## [0.19.7] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- **Critical:** ProviderConfig RBAC was granted on the wrong API group
  - `setupRBAC` requested ProviderConfig and ProviderConfigUsage permissions on `keycloak.crossplane.io`, but the CRDs are generated under `keycloak.m.crossplane.io` (see `apis/v1beta1/groupversion_info.go` and `package/crds/keycloak.m.crossplane.io_providerconfigs.yaml`). The provider's own ClusterRole therefore never matched its own ProviderConfig CRDs.
  - The same mismatch in the `*/finalizers` rule is corrected.
- **Critical:** Missing `events.k8s.io` grant in the runtime ClusterRole
  - `setupRBAC` omitted `create`/`patch`/`update` on `events.k8s.io`, even though `package/crossplane.yaml` already declared it. The two are now consistent.
- **Groups controller: two resources no longer fight over one user's group membership**
  - `Exhaustive` defaults to `true`, which makes a `Groups` resource authoritative for the *complete* set of a user's memberships — `sync` removes every group not listed. Two `Groups` resources for the same user therefore deleted each other's memberships on every reconcile, while both kept reporting `Synced=True` and `Ready=True`. The user's membership oscillated and the conflict was invisible from either resource.
  - `Observe` now lists sibling `Groups` resources in the namespace and, when another *exhaustive* resource resolves to the same Keycloak user in the same realm, refuses to sync: it marks the resource `Ready=False`, emits a `Warning` event with reason `MembershipConflict` naming the conflicting resources, and returns an error so the reconciler stops before `Update` performs any membership changes.
  - Additive siblings (`exhaustive: false`), siblings in another realm, siblings resolving to a different user, and siblings being deleted are not treated as conflicts.
- **Groups controller: `Ready` now reflects convergence**
  - `Observe` set `Available()` unconditionally, reporting `Ready=True` even when the observed membership differed from what the resource declares and `Update` was about to rewrite it. It now sets `Available()` only when the membership matches, and `Ready=False` with an explanatory message otherwise.

### Added
- `VERSION` file and an `internal/version` package, so the resolved release version is logged once at provider startup instead of being implicit.
- `spec.crossplane.version: ">=v2.5.0"` in `package/crossplane.yaml`, and `CROSSPLANE_VERSION ?= 2.5.0` in the Makefile.

### Changed
- **Release publishing** is now tag-driven and restricted to exact SemVer tags pointing at the current `origin/master`. It builds and publishes `linux_amd64` and `linux_arm64` xpkg files, aliases `latest`, verifies equal digests and both architectures, and authenticates to ghcr.io with a GitHub token instead of OIDC claims.
- `scripts/release.sh` hardened: validates the SemVer format, requires a clean worktree, requires `HEAD` to equal `origin/master`, requires `VERSION` to match the requested version, and refuses to proceed if the tag already exists locally or remotely.
- README install instructions use `kubectl crossplane install provider` against the pinned version, replacing a placeholder Helm repository.

## [0.19.6] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Rate limit backoff deadline was being ignored by Crossplane's managed.Reconciler because deadline info was embedded in error message text, not in a structured error type
  - Created custom `RateLimitError` type with `Deadline()` and `RequeueAfter()` methods
  - Added jitter to backoff deadline to prevent thundering herd after backoff window expires
  - Crossplane can now detect RateLimitError and apply the actual deadline instead of generic backoff
  - Fixes Group membership sync failures where deadlines were ignored and reconciles retried immediately upon expiration

### Added
- **Test suite added for all 23 controllers.** *(Corrected 2026-10-03: this originally read "100% coverage". The tests exercised each package's mock rather than the controller, so ten controllers were left at 0% statement coverage despite having test files. Real coverage was measured at 21.9% in 2026-10. See 0.20.1.)*
  - Previously: 44% coverage (11/25 controllers), Groups controller shipped untested → shipped bug in v0.19.4
  - Now: All 23 controllers have regression tests using mock pattern
  - 68+ test cases covering observe, create, update, delete operations
  - Tests verify that operations actually persist (e.g., `AddUserToGroup` really adds the user)
  - Prevents regression of silent failures like Groups controller OIDC sync bug
  - New tests: authenticationflow, authorizationpolicy, clientcertificates, component, events, identityprovider, realmimpexp, realmkeys, userfederation, user/groups

## [0.19.5] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Rate limit backoff (HTTP 429) handling had race condition where concurrent reconcilers all passed the backoff check simultaneously, then all hit 429 together, resetting backoff indefinitely
  - Added semaphore-based concurrency limiter (capacity ~3) to prevent thundering herd on 429 errors
  - Now only ~3 requests can be in-flight at once; if any hit 429, backoff triggers before others also breach limit
  - Fixes repeated 429 errors that prevent Group membership and other operations from syncing

## [0.19.4] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Implement missing `Groups` (user↔group membership) Crossplane controller
  - Manages Keycloak user-to-group membership via GitOps
  - Resolves `UserIdRef` and `GroupIdsRefs` by querying Keycloak directly
  - Supports `Exhaustive` flag: when true, removes unlisted group memberships; when false, additive-only
  - Enables OIDC group-based RBAC (e.g., cluster-admin via Keycloak group membership)

## [0.19.2] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed
- **Critical:** HTTP 429 rate limit backoff mechanism was incorrectly clearing on error responses, preventing backoff from working
  - Rate limit backoff now persists until successful (2xx) response
  - Applies Retry-After header from server when present (RFC 7231 compliant)
  - Falls back to exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s... capped at 30s) for consecutive hits
- Scope deletion now correctly reports `ResourceExists=false` when scope not found

### Added
- Comprehensive rate limit test coverage (7 new test functions, coverage 38.1% → 41.5%)
  - Tests for Retry-After parsing, backoff state management, exponential backoff progression
  - Integration tests for doRequest() and doCreate() with rate limiting
- Rate limit tracking for `doCreate()` POST operations (was missing)
- Rate limit tracking for `UpdateRealmRaw()` raw realm updates (was missing)
- Complete technical documentation: [docs/RATE_LIMITING.md](docs/RATE_LIMITING.md)

### Changed
- Rate limit handling now consistent across all HTTP methods (doRequest, doCreate, UpdateRealmRaw)
- Release workflow now on canonical single-job pattern

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Resolve CRD group registration issue when CRDs are deleted/recreated ([#1](https://github.com/rossigee/provider-keycloak/issues/1))
  - CRD manifests now have properly defined API groups, allowing Crossplane RBAC system to properly initialize provider revision clusterroles
  - Regenerated all CRD manifests with correct group specifications using kubebuilder annotations

### Added
- Comprehensive Client resource configuration support with 20+ new fields:
  - **Additional URLs:** `homeUrl`, `adminUrl`, `frontchannelLogoutUrl`, `backchannelLogoutUrl`
  - **Logout Configuration:** `backchannelLogoutSessionRequired`, `backchannelLogoutRevokeOfflineSessions`
  - **Session Timeouts:** `clientSessionIdleTimeout`, `clientSessionMaxLifespan`, `clientOfflineSessionIdleTimeout`, `clientOfflineSessionMaxLifespan`
  - **Client Flags:** `publicClient`, `bearerOnly`, `consentRequired`, `fullScopeAllowed`, `alwaysDisplayInConsole`, `authorizationServicesEnabled`, `oauth2DeviceAuthorizationGrantEnabled`, `standardTokenExchangeEnabled`, `useRefreshTokens`
  - **Protocol Configuration:** `protocol`, `pkceCodeChallengeMethod`, `accessTokenLifespan`
- Enhanced client controller with comprehensive field sync and change detection logic
- Improved code quality through refactored state comparison functions (reduced cyclomatic complexity)

### Changed
- Restructured CRD naming from underscore-prefixed to properly-grouped filenames (e.g., `_clients.yaml` → `openidclient.keycloak.crossplane.io_clients.yaml`)
- Updated API type definitions with package-level group declarations for proper CRD generation

### Documentation
- Fixed README API group documentation for Group resource (was `group.keycloak.crossplane.io`, now correctly `user.keycloak.crossplane.io`)
- Updated managed resource types table with accurate API groups

## Initial Release

Initial native Crossplane provider for Keycloak with support for:
- OpenID Connect Clients
- Realms
- Users and Groups
- Roles
- Protocol Mappers
- ProviderConfig for Keycloak instance credentials
